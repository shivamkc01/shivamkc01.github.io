ðŸ‘‹ Hello, and welcome to the repo for [my personal website](https://silvia.rbind.io)!

This version was made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and inspired by the [Hugo ApÃ©ro theme](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/).

I keep this repository public so that people can repo-dive and learn how to recreate what they like for their own site. This is how I learned! ðŸ™Œ

In return, I only ask that you avoid duplicating my site for yourself without permission. A lot of thought went into making my site unique to me and your site deserves to reflect your own unique style too!

Thanks and happy repo-diving! ðŸ¤¿ <a href='https://app.netlify.com/sites/silvia/deploys'><img src='https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4d7dccd9-ec21-47eb-b218-34cb5b768883/deploy-status' align="right" height="20" alt='Netlify Status'/></a>
